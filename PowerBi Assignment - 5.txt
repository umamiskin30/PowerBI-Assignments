1. Explain DAX.
- DAX stands for Data Analysis Expressions, and it is a formula language used in Power BI, Power Pivot, and Analysis Services to perform calculations, create custom measures, and define calculated columns. DAX is specifically designed for data modeling and analysis, and it offers a rich set of functions and operators to manipulate and summarize data.




2. Explain datasets, reports, and dashboards and how they relate to each other?
- Datasets, reports, and dashboards are integral components of Power BI and are closely related to each other. Here's an explanation of each:

* Datasets: A dataset in Power BI is a collection of data that is organized and structured for analysis. It typically consists of tables that contain rows and columns of data. 

* Reports: Reports in Power BI are interactive visualizations that are built on top of datasets. A report is a collection of visual elements, such as charts, tables, and graphs, that provide a visual representation of the underlying data. Reports allow users to explore and analyze the data, create custom visuals, apply filters and slicers, and define interactions between visuals. Reports provide insights and allow users to drill down into specific details or dimensions of the data.

3. Dashboards: Dashboards in Power BI are customizable and interactive canvases that provide a consolidated view of key metrics and insights from multiple reports and datasets. Dashboards typically consist of a combination of visualizations, such as charts, tiles, and images, that are arranged in a meaningful layout.

The relationship between datasets, reports, and dashboards is as follows:

- Datasets serve as the source of data for reports and dashboards. Reports are created by connecting to specific datasets and visualizing the data in meaningful ways.
- Reports provide in-depth analysis and exploration of the data within a specific context. Users can create multiple reports based on the same dataset or different datasets, depending on their analysis needs.
- Dashboards provide a consolidated view of key metrics and insights from multiple reports and datasets. Dashboards can include visualizations from different reports and allow users to monitor and analyze data from different perspectives.






3. How reports can be created in power BI, explain two ways with Navigation of each.
- Reports can be created in Power BI using two main methods: Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service. Here's an explanation of each method along with their navigation:

1. Power BI Desktop:

   - Transform and Model Data: Once connected to the data source, you can use the Power Query Editor to transform and shape the data as needed. You can perform operations like filtering, merging, and creating calculated columns to prepare the data for analysis.
   - Create Visualizations: After modeling the data, navigate to the Report view by clicking on the "Report" tab at the top. Here, you can select different visualizations from the Visualizations pane on the right and drag and drop them onto the canvas. You can then configure the visualizations by assigning data fields to specific roles (e.g., X-axis, Y-axis, values) and applying formatting options.
   - Design and Format: Customize the report layout, apply themes, add titles, and adjust the formatting of visuals using the formatting options available in the Visualizations and Format panes. You can also add additional pages to the report to organize and present your data effectively.
   - Save and Publish: Once you are satisfied with your report, save it in Power BI Desktop format (.pbix) on your computer. You can then publish the report to the Power BI Service by clicking on "Publish" in the Home tab. Sign in to your Power BI account and choose the desired workspace to publish the report.

2. Power BI Service:
   - Sign in to Power BI Service: Open a web browser and navigate to the Power BI Service website (app.powerbi.com). Sign in with your Power BI account credentials.
   - Create a New Report: In the Power BI Service, click on "Create" in the top navigation bar and select "Report" from the drop-down menu.
   - Connect to Data: Similar to Power BI Desktop, you can connect to your data source by clicking on "Get Data" and selecting the appropriate data source. Follow the prompts to establish the connection and select the required tables or fields.
   - Design and Build Visualizations: In the Report view of Power BI Service, you can drag and drop visualizations from the Visualizations pane on the right onto the canvas. Assign data fields to the visualizations and configure the formatting options.
   - Add Pages and Interactions: You can add multiple pages to the report to organize different views or sections. Additionally, you can define interactions between visuals to create drill-through experiences or filtering behaviors.
   - Collaborate and Share: Power BI Service allows for collaboration by sharing reports with other users or groups. You can control access permissions, share a read-only view or allow others to edit the report, and add comments or annotations to specific visuals.
   - Publish and Embed: Once the report is complete, click on "Save" to save the changes. The report is automatically saved to the cloud in your Power BI workspace. You can then publish the report to share it with others or embed it in other applications or websites using the embed code provided by Power BI.

6. In Power BI visualization, what are Reading View and Editing view?
- In Power BI, Reading View and Editing View are two different modes that allow users to interact with and modify visualizations within a report. Here's an explanation of each mode:

1. Reading View:
   - Reading View is the default mode when you open a report in Power BI.
   - In Reading View, you can explore and interact with the visualizations in a report, but you cannot make any changes to the report structure or design.
   - In this view, you can view and interact with the data visualizations, apply filters and slicers, drill down into data hierarchies, and perform other interactions to analyze the data.
   - Reading View is typically used for consuming and exploring the report without making any modifications. It is suitable for sharing the report with others who need to view and interact with the data without editing the report itself.

2. Editing View:
   - Editing View is the mode that allows you to modify and design the structure, layout, and content of a report.
   - In Editing View, you have access to various editing and authoring tools to make changes to the report, such as adding or removing visualizations, creating new pages, adjusting visuals and formatting, adding calculated columns or measures, and managing data connections.
   - This view provides a comprehensive set of options to customize the report, including changing visual types, arranging visuals on the canvas, configuring interactions between visuals, and applying formatting and theme settings.
   - Editing View is typically used by report authors, designers, or analysts who need to create, modify, or enhance the report's design, layout, and functionality.
